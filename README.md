Using data collected from Google playstore for data analysis
This project is an analysis of the data set collected on Kaggle by Lavanya Gupta, and can be viewed on this website https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps.
There are two datasets: one which includes:

the name of the Apps,

their category,

number of reviews,

the size of the App,

number if intalls,

type of app and price,

the content rating,

genre,

the last time it was updated,

current version and android version.

the second data set contains:

App
Translated_Review Sentiment

Sentiment_Polarity

Sentiment_Subjectivity

I will be using the python libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn to clean and prepare the data to create graphs and answer five questions using the techniques I have gained from the jovian zero to pandas course.
